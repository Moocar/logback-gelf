logback-gelf
============

A [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) appender that encodes logs to
[GELF](https://www.graylog.org/resources/gelf/) and transports them
to [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/) servers.

**Disclaimer: This repo is no longer maintained as of v0.3 as I've
  stopped using Graylog (different job). Please reach out at
  anthony@moocar.me if you wish to take over the repo. Some 
  alternative GELF appenders for logback are listed below**

Configuring Logback
---------------------

__Note, 0.2 is a breaking version. It is NOT compatible with 0.12 and
previous versions. Read about the changes [here](#v02-changes)__

The minimal possible logback.xml you can write is something like.

```xml
<configuration>
    <appender name="GELF UDP APPENDER" class="me.moocar.logbackgelf.GelfUDPAppender">
        <encoder class="me.moocar.logbackgelf.GZIPEncoder">
            <layout class="me.moocar.logbackgelf.GelfLayout"/>
        </encoder>
    </appender>
   <root level="debug">
    <appender-ref ref="GELF UDP APPENDER" />
  </root>
</configuration>
```

A more complete example that shows how you would overwrite many
default values:

```xml
<configuration>
    <!--Use TCP instead of UDP-->
    <appender name="GELF TCP APPENDER" class="me.moocar.logback.net.SocketEncoderAppender">
        <remoteHost>somehost.com</remoteHost>
        <port>12201</port>
        <encoder class="ch.qos.logback.core.encoder.LayoutWrappingEncoder">
            <layout class="me.moocar.logbackgelf.GelfLayout">
                <!--An example of overwriting the short message pattern-->
                <shortMessageLayout class="ch.qos.logback.classic.PatternLayout">
                    <pattern>%ex{short}%.100m</pattern>
                </shortMessageLayout>
                <!-- Use HTML output of the full message. Yes, any layout can be used (please don't actually do this)-->
                <fullMessageLayout class="ch.qos.logback.classic.html.HTMLLayout">
                    <pattern>%relative%thread%mdc%level%logger%msg</pattern>
                </fullMessageLayout>
                <useLoggerName>true</useLoggerName>
                <useThreadName>true</useThreadName>
                <useMarker>true</useMarker>
                <host>Test</host>
                <additionalField>ipAddress:_ip_address</additionalField>
                <additionalField>requestId:_request_id</additionalField>
                <includeFullMDC>true</includeFullMDC>
                <fieldType>requestId:long</fieldType>
                <!--Facility is not officially supported in GELF anymore, but you can use staticFields to do the same thing-->
                <staticField class="me.moocar.logbackgelf.Field">
                  <key>_facility</key>
                  <value>GELF</value>
                </staticField>
            </layout>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <root level="debug">
        <appender-ref ref="GELF TCP APPENDER" />
    </root>
</configuration>
```

## GelfLayout

`me.moocar.logbackgelf.GelfLayout`

This is where most configuration resides, since it's the part that
actually converts a log event into a GELF compatible JSON string.

* **useLoggerName**: If true, an additional field call "_loggerName"
  will be added to each gelf message. Its contents will be the fully
  qualified name of the logger. e.g: `com.company.Thingo`. Default:
  `false`
* **useThreadName**: If true, an additional field call "_threadName"
  will be added to each gelf message. Its contents will be the name of
  the thread. Default: `false`
* **host** The hostname of the host from which the log is being sent.
  Displayed under `source` on web interface. Default:
  `getLocalHostName()`
* **useMarker**: If true, and the user has set a
   [slf4j Marker](http://slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/Marker.html) on their
   log, then the marker.toString() will be added to the gelf message
   as the field "_marker". Default: `false`
* **shortMessageLayout**: The
  [Layout](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html) used to create
  the gelf `short_message` field. Shows up in the message column of
  the log summary in the web interface. Default: `"%ex{short}%.100m"`
  ([PatternLayout](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#ClassicPatternLayout))
* **fullMessageLayout**: The
  [Layout](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html) used to create
  the gelf `full_message` field. Shows up in the message field of the
  log details in the web interface. Default: `"%rEx%m"`
  ([PatternLayout](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#ClassicPatternLayout))
* **additionalFields**: See additional fields below. Default: empty
* **fieldType**: See field type conversion below. Default: empty
  (fields sent as string)
* **staticFields**: See static fields below. Note, now that facility
  is deprecated, use this to set a facility Default: empty
* **staticAdditionalFields**: _deprecated_. Use staticFields. Default:
  empty
* **includeFullMDC**: See additional fields below. Default: `false`

## Transports

Both UDP and TCP transports are supported. UDP is the recommended
graylog transport.

### UDP

UDP can be configured using the
`me.moocar.logbackgelf.GelfUDPAppender` appender. Once messages reach
a certain size, they will be chunked according to the
[gelf spec](https://www.graylog.org/resources/gelf/). A maximum of
128 chunks can be sent per log. If the encoded log is bigger than
that, the log will be dropped. Assuming the default 512 max packet
size, this allows for 65536 bytes (64kb) total per log message
(unzipped).

* **remoteHost**: The remote graylog server host to send log messages
  to (DNS or IP). Default: `"localhost"`
* **port**: The remote graylog server port. Default: `12201`
* **srcPort**: The source port on the local machine. Default: `0` (ephemeral
  port)
* **maxPacketSize**: The maximum number of bytes per datagram packet.
  Once the limit is reached, packets will be chunked. Default: `512`

**GZIP**

For UDP, you have the option of Gzipping the Gelf JSON before sending
over UDP. To do this, replace the
`ch.qos.logback.core.encoder.LayoutWrappingEncoder` encoder with the
`me.moocar.logbackgelf.GZIPEncoder` encoder. E.g

```xml
<appender name="GELF UDP APPENDER" class="me.moocar.logbackgelf.GelfUDPAppender">
    <encoder class="me.moocar.logbackgelf.GZIPEncoder">
        <layout class="me.moocar.logbackgelf.GelfLayout"/>
    </encoder>
</appender>
```

Remember, The GZIP encoder should NOT be used with TCP

### TCP

TCP transport can be configured using the
`me.moocar.logback.net.SocketEncoderAppender` appender. Unfortunately,
the built in Logback [Socket
Appender](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html#SocketAppender)
doesn't give you control of how logs are encoded before being sent
over TCP, which is why you have to use this appender. To make the
system as flexible as possible, I moved this new appender into its
[own library](https://github.com/Moocar/socket-encoder-appender). Note
that due to an unresolved [Graylog
issue](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/issues/127), GZIP
is not supported when using TCP.

```xml
<appender name="GELF TCP APPENDER" class="me.moocar.logback.net.SocketEncoderAppender">
    <port>12201</port>
    <encoder class="ch.qos.logback.core.encoder.LayoutWrappingEncoder">
        <layout class="me.moocar.logbackgelf.GelfLayout">
            ....
        </layout>
    </encoder>
</appender>
```

* **remoteHost**: The remote graylog server host to send log messages
  to (DNS or IP). Default: `"localhost"`
* **port**: The remote graylog server port. Required.
* **maxPacketSize**: The number of logs to keep in memory while the
  graylog server can't be reached. Default: `128`
* **acceptConnectionTimeout**: Milliseconds to wait for a connection
  to be established to the server before failing. Default: `1000`

Extra features
-----------------

## Additional Fields

Additional Fields are extra k/v pairs that can be added to the GELF
json, and thus searched as structured data using graylog. In the slf4j
world, [MDC](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html) (Mapped Diagnostic
Context) is an excellent way of programmatically adding fields to your
GELF messages.

Let's take an example of adding the ip address of the client to every
logged message. To do this we add the ip address as a key/value to the
MDC so that the information persists for the length of the request,
and then we inform logback-gelf to look out for this mapping every
time a message is logged.

1.  Store IP address in MDC

```java
// Somewhere in server code that wraps every request
...
org.slf4j.MDC.put("ipAddress", getClientIpAddress());
...
```

2.  Inform logback-gelf of MDC mapping

```xml
<layout class="me.moocar.logbackgelf.GelfLayout">
    <additionalField>ipAddress:_ip_address</additionalField>
</layout>
```

If the property `includeFullMDC` is set to true, all fields from the
MDC will be added to the gelf message. Any key, which is not listed as
`additionalField` will be prefixed with an underscore. Otherwise the
field name will be obtained from the corresponding `additionalField`
mapping.

If the property `includeFullMDC` is set to false (default value) then
only the keys listed as `additionalField` will be added to a gelf
message.

### Static Fields

Use static additional fields when you want to add a static key value
pair to every GELF message. Key is the additional field key (and
should thus begin with an underscore). The value is a static string.

Now that the GELF `facility` is deprecated, this is how you add a
static facility. StaticFields replace staticAdditionalFields

E.g in the appender configuration:

```xml
<layout class="me.moocar.logbackgelf.GelfLayout">
  <staticField class="me.moocar.logbackgelf.Field">
    <key>_facility</key>
    <value>GELF</value>
  </staticField>
  <staticField class="me.moocar.logbackgelf.Field">
    <key>_node_name</key>
    <value>www013</value>
  </staticField>
</layout>
```

### Static Additional Fields (deprecated)

Static Additional fields have been deprecated and superceded by
staticFields. While they offered a more concise way of expressing the
key/value pair, it was impossible to include a colon in the value.
staticFields are fully structured and don't have this problem.

### Field type conversion

You can configure a specific field to be converted to a numeric type.
Key is the additional field key as inserted into the MDC, value is the
type to convert to. Currently supported types are ``int``, ``long``, ``float`` and ``double``.

```xml
<layout class="me.moocar.logbackgelf.GelfLayout">
    <additionalField>requestId:_request_id</additionalField>
    <fieldType>requestId:long</fieldType>
</layout>
```

If the conversion fails, logback-gelf will leave the field value alone
(i.e.: send it as String) and print the stacktrace

Tests in Clojure
----------------

Logback-gelf tests are written in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/). I
could try and justify this by saying that the tests are better than
they were in java, which is true, but mostly it's because I love
Clojure and have been using it in my day job for over 3 years. I'm
aware this will make it harder for others to submit PRs, and that
pains me a little, but look, treat it as an exercise. Clojure will
make you a better programmer.

The good news is that running the tests is just as easy as before.
Simply run `mvn test`.

The other good news, is that we're now using generative testing via
[test.check](https://github.com/clojure/test.check). Tests are
generated based on specs and then properties are asserted. It means
that much more of the possible value space is tested.

If you want to test interactively, you can start a repl using `mvn
clojure:repl`, or if you want to connect via nrepl, use `mvn
clojure:nrepl`

V0.2 Changes
------------

In logback-gelf v0.2, configuration has been reworked to fit better
into the logback ecosystem. The primary driver was adding TCP
transport. Under 0.12 configuration, a transport option would have
been added to the main appender, but then there would be no logical
place to put TCP specific configuration such as connectTimeout. UDP
also has its own quirks, requiring chunking and the option of GZIP.

So the new configuration follows the logback way and provides both UDP
and TCP appenders, and the GELF serialization logic is now in a
GelfLayout. This required a significant refactor but will provide more
flexibility going forward. For example, adding a Kafka or AMPQ
appender should now be trivial, and you won't even need to modify this
library.

Because it's such a big change, I deliberately broke backwards
compatibility. Here's a list of all the changes:

- `me.moocar.logbackgelf.GelfAppender` has been removed and replaced
  with `me.moocar.logbackgelf.GelfUDPAppender` and
  `me.moocar.logback.net.SocketEncoderAppender` (all non transport
  configuration is now under the `GelfLayout` Layout)
- **graylog2ServerHost** is now `GelfUDPAppender.remoteHost` or
  `SocketEncoderAppender.remoteHost`
- **graylog2ServerPort** is now `GelfUDPAppender.port` or
  `SocketEncoderAppender.port`
- **facility** is deprecated in GELF 1.1, so I've removed it. It can
  be added using
  [Static Additional Fields](#static-additional-fields).
- **hostName** is now **host** (to be inline with Gelf spec)
- **graylog2ServerVersion** no longer exists since it's assumed that
  you are using graylog 1.0 or above.
- **chunkThreshold** is now `GelfUDPAppender.maxPacketSize` and the
  default is 512 bytes.
- **messagePattern** is now **fullMessageLayout** and is no longer
  assumed to be a
  [PatternLayout](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#ClassicPatternLayout),
  rather it is a generic
  [Layout](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html), giving you full
  flexibility over how a message string is transformed. For example,
  if you really wanted, you could use a XML or HTML layout.
- **shortMessagePattern** same as above. Note that auto truncation no
  longer occurs. You must now describe how to format the log message
  using Layouts.
- Testing is [now in Clojure](#tests-in-clojure)
